## Instruction
This project aims to develop a slightly modified version of the dartboard algorithm using Parallel programming. Instead of a square board with an inscribed circular frontend, we have a circular board
with an inscribed square frontend.

Suppose p the radius of the circle is r. The inscribed square therefore has each side of length is 1.414 * r.

Let N darts be thrown at the circular board and M of them land inside the square. 

Following the same principle as the dartboard method: for large N, we have:

PI = 2* N / M

The more darts you simulate throwing at the board, the better the approximation of PI would be.
